# Suffix Tree (Ukkonen)

**Algorithm Group:** Pattern Matching / String Indexing  
**Implementation:** `SuffixTree` project (`SuffixTree/`)

---

## 1. Overview

A suffix tree is a compressed trie of all suffixes of a string. It supports fast substring search and is a core index structure used by several pattern matching tasks in this repository.

This implementation follows Ukkonen's online construction algorithm and is optimized for high performance in C#.

## 2. Complexity

| Operation | Complexity | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Build | O(n) | Ukkonen's algorithm |
| Contains | O(m) | Match along edges |
| Find all occurrences | O(m + k) | k = number of matches |
| Count occurrences | O(m) | Uses precomputed leaf counts |
| Longest repeated substring | O(1) | Precomputed during construction |
| Longest common substring | O(m) | Uses suffix links |

## 3. Implementation Highlights

- Online construction with active point and remainder tracking.
- Suffix links for amortized O(1) jumps between internal nodes.
- Edge compression (tree, not trie) for memory efficiency.
- Internal terminator key to avoid conflicts with any input character.
- Read-only queries are thread-safe after build.

## 4. API Sketch

```csharp
var tree = SuffixTree.Build("banana");
bool exists = tree.Contains("ana");
var positions = tree.FindAllOccurrences("ana");
int count = tree.CountOccurrences("ana");

string lrs = tree.LongestRepeatedSubstring();
string lcs = tree.LongestCommonSubstring("bandana");

foreach (var suffix in tree.EnumerateSuffixes())
{
    Console.WriteLine(suffix);
}
```
