## 1. Evidence Summary

### 1.1 Authoritative Sources

| Source | URL | Accessed |
|--------|-----|----------|

### 1.2 Algorithm Description (Wikipedia/Gusfield)

**Exact Pattern Matching using Suffix Trees:**

Given a text T of length n and a pattern P of length m:
1. Build suffix tree for T in O(n) time
2. Search for pattern P by traversing tree edges matching P characters
3. All occurrences are found by enumerating leaves in the subtree below match point

**Complexity:**
- Search: O(m + z) where m = pattern length, z = number of occurrences
- Contains check: O(m)
- Count: O(m) when leaf counts are pre-computed

### 1.3 Edge Cases from Evidence

| Edge Case | Expected Behavior | Source |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Empty pattern | Returns all positions (0..n-1) OR empty, implementation-defined | Wikipedia: substring definition |
| Pattern not found | Returns empty collection | Standard |
| Pattern = entire text | Returns [0] | Gusfield |
| Overlapping occurrences | All positions returned | Rosalind example: "ATAT" in "GATATATGCATATACTT" → 2,4,10 |
| Pattern longer than text | Returns empty | Standard |
| Single character pattern | All occurrences of that character | Standard |
| Null pattern | ArgumentNullException | Implementation |

### 1.4 Rosalind Test Case (SUBS Problem)

From Rosalind bioinformatics platform:
- **Input:** s = "GATATATGCATATACTT", t = "ATAT"
- **Output:** 2, 4, 10 (1-indexed; our 0-indexed: 1, 3, 9)
- **Note:** Positions are overlapping occurrences

### 1.5 Known Test Strings from Literature

| Text | Pattern | Occurrences (0-indexed) | Source |
|------|---------|-------------------------|--------|
| "banana" | "ana" | [1, 3] | Wikipedia suffix tree |
| "banana" | "a" | [1, 3, 5] | Standard |
| "banana" | "na" | [2, 4] | Standard |
| "mississippi" | "issi" | [1, 4] | Gusfield |
| "mississippi" | "i" | [1, 4, 7, 10] | Standard |

## 5. Wrapper/Delegate Tests

### GenomicAnalyzer.FindMotif and MotifFinder.FindExactMotif

These are wrappers that delegate to `SuffixTree.FindAllOccurrences`. Minimal smoke tests only.

| ID | Test Case | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------|
| W1 | Single occurrence smoke | Verify delegation works |
| W2 | Case normalization | Wrappers normalize to uppercase |
| W3 | Empty motif returns empty | Different behavior from SuffixTree |

## 8. Open Questions / Decisions

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Empty pattern behavior | Returns all positions | Consistent with regex "" behavior |
| Case sensitivity | Case-sensitive | Canonical SuffixTree behavior; wrappers normalize |
| Span empty pattern | Returns empty (differs from string) | Implementation note documented |

---

## 9. Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Justification |
|----|------------|---------------|
| A1 | Tests use "banana" as canonical test string | Wikipedia suffix tree article uses it |
| A2 | Overlapping matches are all reported | Rosalind and standard string search semantics |
