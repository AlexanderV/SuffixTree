### 1.2 Algorithm Description

#### Position Weight Matrix (Wikipedia)

> A position weight matrix (PWM), also known as a position-specific weight matrix (PSWM) 
> or position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), is a commonly used representation of 
> motifs (patterns) in biological sequences.

**Construction Process (Wikipedia):**

1. **Position Frequency Matrix (PFM):** Count occurrences of each nucleotide at each position
2. **Position Probability Matrix (PPM):** Normalize by dividing by number of sequences
3. **Position Weight Matrix (PWM):** Convert to log-odds using background model

**Log-odds Formula (Wikipedia):**
$$M_{k,j} = \log_2\left(\frac{M_{k,j}}{b_k}\right)$$

Where:
- $M_{k,j}$ is the probability of nucleotide k at position j
- $b_k$ is the background frequency (typically 0.25 for DNA)

**Pseudocounts (Wikipedia/Nishida et al.):**
> Pseudocounts (or Laplace estimators) are often applied when calculating PPMs if 
> based on a small dataset, in order to avoid matrix entries having a value of 0.

**Scoring (Wikipedia):**
> When the PWM elements are calculated using log likelihoods, the score of a sequence 
> can be calculated by adding (rather than multiplying) the relevant values at each 
> position in the PWM. The sequence score gives an indication of how different the 
> sequence is from a random sequence.

**Score Interpretation:**
- Score = 0: Equal probability of being functional vs random site
- Score > 0: More likely to be a functional site
- Score < 0: More likely to be a random site

#### Profile Matrix (Rosalind CONS Problem)

> A profile matrix is a 4×n matrix P in which P_{1,j} represents the number of 
> times that 'A' occurs in the jth position of one of the strings.

**Consensus String (Rosalind):**
> A consensus string c is a string of length n formed from our collection by taking 
> the most common symbol at each position.
